# CSharp


```cs
//Multiple-Variable Declarations
// Variable declarations--some with initializers, some without
int var3 = 7, var4, var5 = 3;
double var6, var7 = 6.52;
```

## Nullable Types
```cs
bool myBool = null;	//you'd get a compiler error.
DateTime myDate = null;	//you'd get a compiler error.

//these statements will compile just fine
bool? myNulableInt = null;
DateTime? myNullableDate = null;


//You can always convert a value type to a nullable type:
DateTime myDate = DateTime.Now;
DateTime? myNullableDate = myDate;

myDate = (DateTime) myNullableDate;


myDate = myNullableDate.Value;

```


## Constructors 

```cs
public class Taxi
{
    public bool isInitialized;
    public Taxi()
    {
        isInitialized = true;
    }
}

class TestTaxi
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Taxi t = new Taxi();
        Console.WriteLine(t.isInitialized);
    }
}
```


### Prevent a class from being instantiated by making the constructor private, as follows:
```cs
class NLog
{
    // Private Constructor:
    private NLog() { }

    public static double e = Math.E;  //2.71828...
}
```


```cs
public class Employee
{
    public int salary;

    public Employee(int annualSalary)
    {
        salary = annualSalary;
    }

    public Employee(int weeklySalary, int numberOfWeeks)
    {
        salary = weeklySalary * numberOfWeeks;
    }
}

Employee e1 = new Employee(30000);
Employee e2 = new Employee(500, 52);
```


### A constructor can use the base keyword to call the constructor of a base class. 
```cs
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public Manager(int annualSalary)
        : base(annualSalary)
    {
        //Add further instructions here.
    }
}
```


```cs
public Employee(int weeklySalary, int numberOfWeeks)
    : this(weeklySalary * numberOfWeeks)
{
}
```


## Destructors 

### a declaration of a destructor for the class Car:
class Car
{
    ~Car()  // destructor
    {
        // cleanup statements...
    }
}

### The destructor implicitly calls Finalize on the base class of the object. 
protected override void Finalize()
{
    try
    {
        // Cleanup statements...
    }
    finally
    {
        base.Finalize();
    }
}

### creates three classes that make a chain of inheritance
class First
{
    ~First()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("First's destructor is called.");
    }
}

class Second : First
{
    ~Second()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("Second's destructor is called.");
    }
}

class Third : Second
{
    ~Third()
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine("Third's destructor is called.");
    }
}

class TestDestructors
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Third t = new Third();
    }

}
/* Output (to VS Output Window):
    Third's destructor is called.
    Second's destructor is called.
    First's destructor is called.
*/
